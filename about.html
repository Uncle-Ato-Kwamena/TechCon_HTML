            <p>Fred Swaniker (born 1976) is a Ghanaian serial entrepreneur and leadership development expert on a mission to help the world's most extraordinary talent fulfil its potential. Swaniker recognized the importance of leadership and education while serving as the headmaster of a secondary school founded by his mother at the age of 17, and believed that the missing ingredient needed to transform Africa was good leadership. To solve that problem, he started the African Leadership Group â€“ an ecosystem of organizations that are catalyzing a new era of ethical, entrepreneurial African leaders.</p>
